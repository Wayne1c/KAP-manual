## Integration with Cognos 10.X

### Install Kyligence ODBC Driver

Please refer to this guide [Kyligence ODBC Driver Tutorial](../driver/kyligence-odbc.en.md) for installation.

The Kyligence ODBC driver needs to be installed in the machine or virtual environment where your Cognos Server is installed.

### Create a Data Source in Cognos

Depending on your business scenario, you may need to create a new project or simply use an existing project to create the data source for KAP. In the example, we will start with a new project.

Next, use `Metadata Wizard` create a new `Data Source`.

In next step, choose `ODBC` as the connection type. For Isolation Level, choose `Use the default object gateway`

Next, in ODBC data source, fill in the DSN name that you created in the previous step.

Check `Unicode ODBC`. For Signon `choose no authorization`.

Then Click `Test the connection`.
