4. Change the default scripts of "TimeFormat", "DateFormat" and "TimestampFormat" to:

`SET TimeFormat='h:mm:ss';`
`SET DateFormat='YYYY-MM-DD';`
`SET TimestampFormat='YYYY-MM-DD h:mm:ss[.fff]';`

5. Load columns from KAP to Qlik Sense:

As we have logged in KAP and select the project **learn_kylin** during local DSN configuration, currently we only need to new a query **select * from KYLIN_SALES** in KAP.

![Query in KAP](images/qlik/kap_query.png)

Export the query results and copy them to the script editor in Qlik Sense Desktop with comma as delimiter. 

![Script Running](images/qlik/script_run_result.png)

In the running result, the line count shall be the same as in KAP. In this case, the line count is 10,000.
